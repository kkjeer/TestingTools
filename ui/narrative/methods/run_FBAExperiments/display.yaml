  fbamodel_id:
    ui-name: |
      FBA model
    short-hint: |
      The metabolic model consisting of genome-wide set of stoichiometric reactions, compounds, and the weighted components of the biomass on which you wish to carry out Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). This model can be built using the “Build Metabolic Model” App.
    placeholder: |
      Model for FBA

  media_id:
    ui-name: |
      Media (defaults to Complete media)
    short-hint: |
      Media specifies the set of chemical compounds an organism can use for its growth. If left blank, the default Complete media is used. The “Complete” media is an abstraction of what is available in our biochemistry database. Every compound that can be transported from the extracellular compartment into the cell–or, in other words, for which a transport reaction is available–is used in the Complete media. This list is built in real-time, meaning that whenever you run FBA with Complete media, the available transporters are parsed from the media database–and is therefore not stored permanently in any media object in the workspace.

      Growth condition for FBA

  compound_id:
    ui-name: |
      Compound id
    short-hint: |
      Compound to vary in one variation.

parameter-groups:
  experiments:
    ui-name: |
      Experiments
    short-hint: |
      Set of experiments (each consisting of a set of variations on the base media).

  <p>This app runs flux balance analysis multiple times, given one base organism, one base media, and a set of experiments (where each experiment consists of a set of variations to the base media).</p>
